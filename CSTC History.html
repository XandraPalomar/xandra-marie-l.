  <h4>Our History
    CSTC’s humble beginnings trace back on January 1991
    <br />
    <br />
    This ideal has enthused Mr. Nelson Diasanta Mendoza, Founder, President and CEO of CSTC Inc., to take passion in establishing an educational institution that would cater to the needs of aspiring students and would-be professionals, technocrats
    and service people.
    <br />
    <br />
    CSTC’s humble beginnings trace back on January 1991 when it offered its first Computer Literacy Program (CLP) under the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), in partnership with Holy Rosary Academy in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. The
    pioneering years were very challenging yet a promising one. After two years, in 1993, CSTC offered another Computer Literacy Awareness Program (CLAP), in partnership with Leon Guinto Memorial College in Atimonan, Quezon. In 1996, the CLAP
    expanded to Sariaya, Quezon in partnership with Lutucan National High School, Canda National High School, Sariaya Institute and Sariaya East Central School. From 1991 to 1997, CSTC under the banner of CSTC Computer Systems Technology Center,
    became a training provider of Computer Literacy Program under DECS.
    <br />
    <br />
    On July 7, 1997, CSTC Computer Systems Technology Center was officially registered and recognized as a TVET Provider under the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). Since then, CSTC continues to move forward and farther at
    a pace fast enough to be at the forefront of the technical education development and progress. From 1997 to 2003, CSTC Computer Systems Technology Center continued to flourish as a TESDA Registered Training Center, with branches in Atimonan and
    Sariaya, Quezon.
    <br />
    <br />
    In 2004, as it offered long-term technological courses. CSTC changed its name to CSTC Computer Systems Technological College. During this period, CSTC began to make noise as a pacesetter not only in the field of technical education and training,
    but in skills excellence as well. CSTC had the privilege to participate in different skills competitions locally and internationally. From provincial to regional level, zonal to national competitions, and up to competing at World Skills Asean
    Competition as a Philippine representative. Proud CSTCians continue to rise up with the challenges of global demands in skills competency, bringing home the glory and victory.
    <br />
    <br />
    In the year 2011, CSTC was blessed to open Higher Education Degree Programs under the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), offering following courses; BSED Bachelor of Secondary Education, BSIT Bachelor of Information Technology, BSBA Bachelor
    of Business Administration, BSHRM Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management. CSTC was consistently ranked among the 2017, 2018 and 2019 Best Philippine Schools to study SECONDARY TEACHER EDUCATION based on overall board exam
    performance, number of examinees, top performing examinees, accreditation status, and faculty-student ratio. CSTC also prospered in the field of Information Technology, Business Administration and Tourism and Hospitality Management Education,
    with several winnings in various Regional and National Competitions participated by both professionals and students.
    <br />
    <br />

    most numbered of senior high school students in the province.
    <br />
    <br />
    In 2015, with its rapid growth that underscore its vision of becoming a top transformational learning institution, CSTC formerly known as CSTC Computer Systems Technological College, Inc., changed its name to the CSTC College of Sciences,
    Technology and Communications, Inc., to continuously build its quality standard which is defined in its ultimate goal: BESTFORMS
